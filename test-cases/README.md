# Test cases
1. The theoretical test case **from the paper**.
2. A **straight line** with no houses.
3. A simple example of a **4-cycle**.
4. A simple example of a **3-cycle**.
5. An example of a **"star"** with just lines coming from one manhole.
6. A case when we have **no junction variables**, only paths with one edge.
7. A more complex case with no cycles.
8. A more complex case with no cycles.
9. A case where the first solution is not without no-manhole paths.
10. An example where a solution only exists if we allow unbalanced house edges.
