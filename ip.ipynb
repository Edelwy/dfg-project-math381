    "We implemented the IP model using an optimization software called **`Gurobi`** alongside the Python package **`networkx`** in order to manipulate graphs. \n",
    "Here is the quick summery of the code, with a lot of comments to make the model implementation easier to read. For details on the model itself, and the structure, reasoning and problem statement go to the paper, that is also available in [Github](https://github.com/Edelwy/dfg-project-math381). This write-up is meant purely to explain the implementation reasoning, the problem should be known to the reader prior to reading this.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we set up the environment and import packages. `networkx` is used for working with graphs and their elements, without having to implement the object structure ourselves. We used it mostly for working with nodes and edges and acquiring their neighbors, etc. The `gurobipy` package is crucial to our model as it is the core of solving the IP problem. It is wildly used for linear programming optimization. It provides 2 main algorithms, the barrier and the simplex method, but these are used for continuous models (real variable values), while we have integer programming (integer variable values). This problem is solved via a series of linear programming relaxations. For more detail, refer to our paper and references."

    "The algorithm traverses each directed edge, to initialize all possible junction variables.  Each variable is stored in a dictionary, whose keys are pairs of edges that create a junction. If two edges share a common node, then the variable is added to our dictionary. We only allow for **integer** values because the number of cables is an integer, therefore the number of connected edges at a junction has to be an integer.\n",

So if `start` is $ab \\in E$ then `end` can be any edge $bc \\in E$. Furthermore, we must also add the variables where the cable is wired from `end` to `start` edge, meaning $cb \\in E$ routing to $ba$. We also ensure that every variable value is possible by adding this constraint to the model here.\n",

We simply iterate through all variables and add the ones that route from a subscriber to a subscriber through any node. Furthermore, we will prune the solutions with paths not connected to a manhole later, but this ensures that the solutions with minimized number of *house-node-house* junctions are at the top of the solution pool. This is useful as a time optimizations, because we will need to prune less solutions before we find one that suits us. \n",

Then we repeat the process for any other variable that is not in the `varsInPath` set. We stitch a junction to a path in 4 cases. If the junction has the same direction as the path we are creating, we stitch it if either the first edge in the junction matches the last in the path or the last edge in the junction matches the first one in the path. We add the edge that is not yet in the path (the one that is not matching). Second case is when the direction is opposite. Then either the last junction edge matches the last path edge or the first junction edge matches the first path edge. We have to continue this until all variables cannot connect anywhere because their value is 0.\n",
